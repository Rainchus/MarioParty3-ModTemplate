# Mario Party 3 Modding Template
A framework for Mario Party 3 that allows editing of some assets and assembly/C injection.

# New Asset Adding
New assets can be added by copying the directory structure of `assets/mp3_extract` (which is generated by running python `python ./mpromtool.py` for the first time)<br/>
Ex: `assets/mp3_extract/filedata/boot/0_0.png` can be replaced with `new_assets/filedata/boot/0_0.png` (which also needs an xml)<br/>
To define a single image xml, it's defined as such<br/>

```
<animdata texfmt="ci8">
    <pattern center_x="160" center_y="120" path="0_0.png"/>
</animdata>
```

# BUILDING
Place a `.z64` of Mario Party 3 US at `rom/mp3.z64`<br/>
To build the images/text banks, use `python ./mpromtool.py` which builds `rom/mp3-mainFS-repack.z64`<br/>
Then do `python ./configure.py` to generate the `build.ninja` file<br/>
Now running `ninja` will build the rom with the asset and codes changes provided at `rom/mp3-mod.z64`<br/><br/>
Any time an asset is changed, `python ./mpromtool.py` needs to be re-ran before doing `ninja`<br/>
Any time a new .s or .c file is added, `python ./configure.py` must be re-ran before doing `ninja`
